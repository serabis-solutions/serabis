# Serabis

First things first run vagrant up, then follow steps in api/README.md to setup api.

From the steps in api/README.md you should be able to generate an agent and account key.

Then follow the steps in agent/README.md to add toml config and setup the agent.

Then navigate to http://dev.serabis/#/?agent={YOUR_AGENT_KEY}

If it all works you might have a graph!

Do some other stuff then profit! $$$
